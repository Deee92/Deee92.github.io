## Hey!

I'm a PhD student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm](https://www.kth.se/profile/deepikat), supervised by Professors [Benoit Baudry](https://softwarediversity.eu/) and [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/). My research is funded by Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program ([WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/)), and focuses on monitoring software applications in production for automated generation of unit tests.
